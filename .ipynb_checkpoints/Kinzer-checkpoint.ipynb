    "### Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this project is to quantify the cost and performance tradeoffs of reducing the fraction of platinum in the catalyst layer for a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. Platinum is the primary electrocatalyst used in PEM fuel cells. The extremely high cost of platinum (~$33,000/kg) is a major component of overall PEM fuel cost, and a barrier to widespread adoption of PEM fuel cells for applications such as transportation and power generation. Additionally, due to the high cost of platinum, catalyst costs do not benefit significantly from economies of scale associated with higher production volumes of fuel cells. This means that reducing the amount of platinum in the catalyst is crucial to reducing system costs for fuel cells to increase cost competitiveness with other technologies. Quantifying the performance tradeoffs of reducing the fraction of platinum would allow one to determine the optimal amount of platinum catalyst that should be used to produce the most cost-effective fuel cell.

    "### Model Formulation\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, a number of simplifications and assumptions are made to allow for a relatively straightforward model which manipulates a single variable -- the fraction of surface area of the carbon in the catalyst layer covered by platinum. Importantly, this is a one-dimensional model of a PEMFC, which considers area and volume solely as necessary to quantify electrochemical processes and volumes of solids within a hypothetical fuel cell. Another assumption is that the diameter of the carbon particles and platinum particles in the catalyst layer are constant. Though it would be worth further investigation to understand the effect of changing the diameter of platinum particles within the catalyst layer, this is beyond the scope of this project. "
