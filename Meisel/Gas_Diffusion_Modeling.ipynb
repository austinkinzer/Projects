The first 980 $\\mathrm{\\mu}$m of the negatrode are too far away from the electrolyte for the reactions to really mattter so this will just be for gas diffusion.  In the last 20 $\\mathrm{\\mu}$m there will be gas diffusion as well as reactions with the negatrode.  The microstructure is the same in both sections.\n",
